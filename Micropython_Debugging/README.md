In MicroPython, there is no debug option like in regular Python and other coding languages. If you want to track and debug the code, you can do it by making use of system interrupts. You can implement a try & catch in the code, and by catching a specific interrupt, you can then run specific code for detailing the interrupt to keep track and debug your code.

This code safely handles an `IndexError` when trying to access an out-of-range index in a list. The try-except block ensures the program continues running without crashing.
