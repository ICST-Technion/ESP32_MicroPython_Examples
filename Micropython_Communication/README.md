# MicroPython Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Example

This code implements a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication interface for the ESP32 using the MicroPython `ubluetooth` module. It provides basic functionality to act as a BLE peripheral device with a custom service (Nordic UART Service). The ESP32 can advertise itself, accept connections from a central device (e.g., a smartphone), and exchange messages via the BLE protocol.

# MicroPython Firebase Example

This script connects an ESP32 to Wi-Fi and interfaces with a Firebase Realtime Database. It demonstrates two main functionalities: pushing data to Firebase and retrieving data from Firebase.

# MicroPython NTP Example

This code connects an ESP32 to Wi-Fi, synchronizes the device's time with an NTP server to get UTC time, and adjusts it to reflect Israel Standard Time (UTC+2). The adjusted time is then converted into a human-readable tuple.
